## Abstract

There are many types of disaster. Some of them cannot be predicted in advance. Therefore, we cannot prepare to handle or evacuate people before the incident, resulting in many victims waiting for help. This paper proposes a system called **IamHere** that can be used as a tool for the rescuers to locate victim easier. In most cases, people will have a smartphone device that has become an integral part of both our work and personal lives. These smartphones can be used for rescue in various emergency situations to reduce the difficulty and resuscitation time of the rescuers. IamHere system is divided into three components, i.e., a website, rescue side application, and victim's application. The websites are for monitoring the user's overall information. The rescue side application can create a unique Wireless LAN (SSID) identifier to activate the application that was installed on the victim's smartphone. Then the victim's phone will generate a loud noise to help the rescue team locate them more easily. The response of rescue experts to the system was that our system was able to provide a reasonable level of assistance. The system also requires the participation from other emergency response sectors for use in various real-world situations.
